That men do not give up on a woman they truly want to be with.  9 out of 10 times, they are referring to when a woman says she no longer wants to be with you, and there is still an opportunity to change her mind.

                <p>At times of trouble, women get emotional & start making decisions based on emotional dependency; children get afraid and start looking for help.

                    Men need to be calm, reserved, and logical whenever shit hits the fan on any occasion.
                    
                    You don't have the option to be emotionally weak. Stay sensible.
                    
                    God gave us men a gift. The gift of staying rational even during the most emotional and troublesome times. You need to capitalize on that, especially at times of trouble when your family depends on you and your sense of rational decision-making, detached from temporary emotions. Get your emotions under control, keep a logical frame at all times.

                <p>Most men who believe they‚Äôre ‚Äúgenetically ungifted‚Äù in terms of looks or even ‚Äúugly‚Äù just haven't tried putting on muscle.

                    Getting muscular and losing fat can reverse a lot of perceived ‚Äúugliness‚Äù for men will literally take you from 1/10 to 7-8/10.
                    
                    A man can basically ‚Äúhack‚Äù his looks by putting on more muscle, losing fat, improving his body composition. It sounds easy in theory, but is hard, takes effort, and takes consistency and patience. But the cost is absolutely worth it.
                    Men have a huge advantage in terms of improving their appearance. Go to the gym, eat better, do better my Gs.

                    The anxiety that you feel around the notion of approaching and making moves on women comes from giving too much of a f*ck and caring too much about what other people think.
                    
                    When you stop giving a flying fuck, you will be empowered to be a BOLD SEDUCER who MAKES SHIT HAPPEN.<span id="dots">...</span>
                    <span id="moreText">The wise seducer is always keeping an eye open for another woman to enter his life.

                        By keeping an orbit of attractive woman, he ensures that he does not fall into low status repulsive patterns of desperation, neediness, or clinginess.
                        
                        Don't let her use you as a texting penpal.
                        
                        Always be escalating the interaction forward towards sex.
                        
                        If you consistently hit a barrier with her, drop her and focus on better leads.
                        
                        The practically ruthless seducer will get far.
                        
                        If you have no standards and you're not selective at all, she'll assume that you're desperate, low-status, and have no other options.
                        
                        Subcommunicate the fact that you are SELECTIVE.
                        
                        TRAIN YOUR BODY, AND MIND EVERY DAY.
                        
                        Being too easy on yourself leads to being a weak man.
                        
                        Fear is the approach killer.
                        
                        The biggest mistake you can make in your early 20s is to be apathetic about the next decade of your life.
                        
                        Failing to plan is akin to planning to fail.
                        
                        You are your own greatest cockblocker.
                        
                        Few will truly understand this.
                        
                        No matter your current state or game NEVER NEVER NEVER lose hope.
                        
                        Every day is another chance!
                        
                        Living a boring life leads to becoming a boring man.
                        
                        Condition her to jump through hoops on your behalf.
                        
                        She has a primal need to prove herself; exploit it.
                        
                        The more she works to win over you approval, the more she will value it when it's finally earned.
                        
                        The secret to having an amazing, feel-good vibe is to see the best in other people. Focus on their good qualities, instead of dwelling on the negative.</span> <button id="btn">Read More</button>

                <h3>Men, Trusting your process means accepting, allowing, embracing, and honoring where you are on your journey.</h3>
                <p>When we feel like we're falling behind in life, we irrationally attempt to find something to relieve us from our suffering.

                    Instead of living life and genuinely trusting our process..
                    
                    We begin searching for shortcuts to peace, fulfillment, success, and excitement.
                    
                    This unnatural desire destroys the spirit.
                    
                    It is resistance to our paths.
                    
                    And all suffering increases with resistance.
                    
                    What if you're exactly where you're supposed to be?
                    
                    Really sit with that thought for a moment.
                    
                    Let it penetrate.
                    
                    Why would you want to be anywhere else if this moment was divinely crafted to perfect imperfection?... <a href="#">Continue Reading</a>
