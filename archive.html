                <p>When you become friends with a woman you want to be romantically involved with then you will pay by being a slave to her.

                    You either escalate from the onset and get rejected or you never meet her.
                    
                    Escalate from on the onset because a friend she sees, a friend you will become. <br>

                <p>Your “friends” who wouldn’t go to war with you if the time calls for it, are not your friends.

                    They are your “chill buddies”. Buddies you drink and play asphalt with.
                    
                    These same buddies will throw you under the bus for a 5/10 woman or $1000. Mark my words.
                    
                    Don't kid yourself by saying these men your “bros”. Real bros stand by their brothers when life hits the fan. Better to be alone and find new friends than only hang with baseless, worthless guys who wouldn’t waste a minute throwing you under the bus if the time calls for it.

                <p>We cannot allow fear to keep us from God's path and purpose for our lives.

                    This is the spiritual foundation for our existence and when we ignore our calling, our gifts, and our purpose... we destroy our ability to connect with others on a higher frequency of consciousness.
                    
                    That's why modern society is in disarray.
                    
                    Everyone wants to escape from God's path and travel down the false road to freedom.

                <p>When we feel like we're falling behind in life, we irrationally attempt to find something to relieve us from our suffering.

                    Instead of living life and genuinely trusting our process..
                    
                    We begin searching for shortcuts to peace, fulfillment, success, and excitement.
                    
                    This unnatural desire destroys the spirit.
                    
                    It is resistance to our paths.
                    
                    And all suffering increases with resistance.
                    
                    What if you're exactly where you're supposed to be?
                    
                    Really sit with that thought for a moment.
